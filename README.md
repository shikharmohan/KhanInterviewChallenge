Hi there,

This was such a fun project to work on! I have completed both functions total infection and limited infection. When you arrive at the page, you will see a sample visualization with 2 connected components - 7 users total. Green nodes are uninfected, blue nodes are infected. If you hover over the nodes, you can see the id number of the node. Edges go from coach to student. 


I would have liked to spend more time on the heuristic for limited_infection - i'm currently finding the minimum uninfected nodes in the space of a given node, however, it doesn't work as well as I would have liked. I primarily used DFS for graph traversal and passing in an infection ID to keep track of nodes visited in a given traversal.


To run the project, just download the repo and open up index.html -that's it! 

Thanks!
